CSSA Vote
=========

PHP web voting interface for the ANU Computer Science Students' Association.

This application takes votes in preferential/Single Transferable Vote elections. It does not count votes -- it simply outputs BLT ballot files to be counted with other applications.

**WARNING**: This is pre-alpha quality code. It was written very, very rapidly to meet an urgent deadline, and is only partially functional. We guarantee nothing!
